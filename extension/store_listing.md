AI-powered study focus manager for students. Detects distraction patterns and provides smart nudges to keep you focused.

## Detailed Description
🎯 AdaptiFocus helps students stay focused while studying online.

Using AI-driven context analysis, AdaptiFocus understands what you're actually doing — not just which website you're on. It can tell the difference between watching a YouTube lecture and watching cat videos!

### How It Works
1. Install and sign in with Google (one click!)
2. Start a study session and tell it what you're working on
3. Browse normally — AdaptiFocus works silently in the background
4. Receive gentle nudges if you spend too much time on distracting content
5. View your focus analytics to understand your study patterns

### Key Features
🧠 Context-Aware AI — Classifies pages by CONTENT, not just domain
📊 Focus Analytics — See hourly focus/distraction breakdowns
🔔 Graduated Interventions — From gentle nudges to stronger reminders
📚 Study Sessions — Track focused study time for different topics
🔒 Privacy First — We only track domains and time, never page content
🔑 One-Click Google Sign-In — No passwords to remember

### Who Is It For?
- University students preparing for exams
- Remote learners struggling with online distractions
- Anyone who wants to understand and improve their focus habits

### Privacy
AdaptiFocus collects domain names and time spent on websites to classify study vs. distraction behavior. We NEVER read your page content, form inputs, or personal data. You can delete all your data at any time.

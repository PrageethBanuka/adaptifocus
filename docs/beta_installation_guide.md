# 🎯 AdaptiFocus Beta Installation Guide

Thank you for trying out AdaptiFocus! 

Since the extension is currently in Beta, it is not yet available on the Chrome Web Store. You will need to load it directly into Google Chrome using "Developer Mode". It only takes **2 minutes**.

> **Privacy First**: AdaptiFocus **DOES NOT** track the specific URLs you visit or the content of the pages. It only securely logs the master domain (like `youtube.com`) and how long you stayed there.

## 📊 Phase 3: Start Browsing!

You're all set! **Just browse normally.**

The AI will silently analyze your browsing habits in the background. The extension icon will change dynamically to show you how you're doing:
* **Green (FOCUS)**: When you are on a highly productive or study-related site.
* **Red (⚠️)**: When you are actively distracted.

Click the extension icon and click **📊 Dashboard** to view your beautiful web dashboard and track your focus stats over time!

**Issues?** Please message the researcher directly on WhatsApp if you have any questions or bugs.

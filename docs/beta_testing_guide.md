## What the Extension Does

### Smart Classification
AdaptiFocus doesn't just block domains — it understands **what you're actually doing**:

| You're Browsing | Classification |
|---|---|
| YouTube → MIT Algorithm Lecture | ✅ **Study** |
| YouTube → Cat Videos | ❌ **Distraction** |
| Reddit → Python Programming | ✅ **Study** |
| Reddit → Memes | ❌ **Distraction** |
| Google Scholar | ✅ **Study** |
| Instagram | ❌ **Distraction** |

### Duration
**2 weeks** of normal browsing with the extension active.

### What We Track
- Which domains you visit (study/distraction/neutral)
- How long you spend on each site
- Whether you respond to focus nudges
- Your study session durations

### What We DON'T Track
- ❌ Page content or text
- ❌ Form inputs or passwords
- ❌ Private/incognito browsing
- ❌ Any personally identifiable data

### Experiment Groups
You'll be randomly assigned to one of three groups:
1. **Adaptive**: Full AdaptiFocus with AI-powered graduated interventions
2. **Static Block**: Simple blocking of known distraction sites
3. **Control**: Extension tracks only, no interventions

You won't know which group you're in until the study ends.
